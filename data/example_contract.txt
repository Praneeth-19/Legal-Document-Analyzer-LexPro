This sounds like an exciting AI application for the legal field! LexPro Law Firm could greatly benefit from an AI-powered tool that processes legal documents efficiently. Here’s how it could work:

### **Key Features of the AI Tool:**
- **Clause Extraction:** Automatically identify and highlight termination, liability, jurisdiction clauses.
- **Document Summarization:** Generate concise summaries of contracts, case files, and court rulings to save time.
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER):** Extract key details like parties involved, dates, statutes, and legal references.

### **Potential Workflow:**
1. **Input Processing:** Lawyers upload legal documents into the AI system.
2. **Automated Analysis:** AI scans for key clauses and extracts relevant information.
3. **Summarization & Tagging:** AI generates a structured summary and highlights named entities.
4. **Review & Refinement:** Lawyers review AI-generated outputs and make adjustments if needed.
